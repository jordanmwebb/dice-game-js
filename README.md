Dice Game
======

#### Fun game that allows two players to roll dice and score points. Win by being the first one to score 100!

### Functionality
This app was built using Vanilla **JavaScript**. The application runs an initialization function every time a new game is started (including on-load) which sets all scores to zero and Player 1 as the active player. When either player reaches the designated winning score, the game ends and a new game can be started. The active player changes when a player decides to hold the points they've accumulated on the current round or they roll a zero.

### Design
This application mimicks a board game in its design. A vibrant background and accent colors were used to create a playful interface. Subtle animations were used for the menu items to validate what option the user is selecting.
